#+TITLE: org-gnus-ical

Capture iCalendar invites from Gnus to Org.

* Usage

Put the bundled =ical2org= script somewhere in =PATH=, then

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package org-gnus-ical
    :load-path "~/src/org-gnus-ical"
    :demand t ; so that it's loaded after gnus even though we use :bind
    :after gnus
    :config
    (add-to-list 'org-capture-templates
                '("c" "iCalendar invite" entry
                  (file+olp "~/org/work.org"
                            "Meetings")
                  (function org-gnus-ical-capture-template))))
#+END_SRC

The above will give you a capture template on key =c= that turns
iCalendar invites into org-mode headings.
